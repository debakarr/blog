### Maximum Subarray

[Link to original Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

>Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

**Solution 1 (Kadane’s Algorithm):**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Algorithm used: Kadane’s Algorithm
        # Take two variables
        # One will keep track of the current max sum
        # Other one will keep track of the global max sum
        # Pointing at an element there can be two options
        # i. Either that element combined with the previous elements is the max sum
        # ii. Or the element itself is greater than the previous sum

        # Make the first element the maxCurrent as well as maxGlobal
        maxCurrent, maxGlobal = nums[0], nums[0]
        
        # Loop starting from the second element and make a check
        for num in nums[1:]:
            # compare between current element and current + previous maxCurrent
            maxCurrent = max(num, maxCurrent + num)

            # If maxCurrent > maxGlobal then change maxGlobal
            # This is require in case say the current element is negative 
            # and previous maxCurrent is positive
            # Then value of maxCurrent will be num + maxCurrent 
            # and obviously it will be less then maxGlobal
            if maxCurrent > maxGlobal:
                maxGlobal = maxCurrent
        
        return maxGlobal
```

**Solution 2 (Dynamic Programming):**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        # Bottom-Up-Approach
        # Make a copy of the array
        # We can also use the array itself, 
        # but for the sake of dynamic programming I am creating a cache
        cache = nums[:]
        
        # Loop starting from second element
        for i in range(1, len(cache)):
            # If the previous element is negative or zero keep the number as it is
            # Else add the previous cummulative sum
            if cache[i - 1] > 0:
                cache[i] = cache[i - 1] + cache[i]
                
        # Return max of the cache
        return max(cache)
```
