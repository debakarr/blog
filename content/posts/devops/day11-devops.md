CI/CD is all about streamlining your software development process.

This is mostly discussed in [Day 1 post](/posts/devops/day1-devops). 

---

## Highlight

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Involves merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository (e.g., Git) as frequently as possible. Automated builds and tests are run on each integration to ensure that the merged code is free of errors and conflicts.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Involves automating the process of deploying the tested and verified code to production environments. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered to users quickly and efficiently.

---

## Benifits of CI/CD

- **Faster feedback**: Automated tests and builds provide immediate feedback on code changes, allowing developers to identify and fix issues early in the development process.
- **Improved collaboration**: CI/CD practices encourage frequent code integrations, which help reduce the risk of conflicts and improve collaboration among team members.
- **Higher code quality**: Regularly running automated tests ensures that code quality is maintained and that new changes do not introduce regressions.
- **Faster delivery**: By automating the deployment process, new features and bug fixes can be delivered to users more quickly and efficiently.

## CI/CD Tools options

### [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/username/repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install poetry'
                sh 'poetry install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'poetry run pytest'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                echo 'Codebase approved, deliver to production environment'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploy changes to production'
                // Add your deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

```yaml
name: CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: "3.8"
    - name: Build
      run: |
        pip install poetry
        poetry install
    - name: Test
      run: |
        poetry run pytest
    - name: Deliver
      run: |
        echo 'Codebase approved, deliver to production environment'
    - name: Deploy
      run: |
        echo 'Deploy changes to production'
        # Add your deployment steps here
```

### [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

{{< admonition tip "Visual Config Editor" >}}
CircleCI has a [Visual Config Editor](https://circleci-public.github.io/visual-config-editor/) which can help you visualize the pipeline.
{{< /admonition >}}

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Build
          command: |
            pip install poetry
            poetry install
      - run:
          name: Test
          command: |
            poetry run pytest
      - run:
          name: Deliver
          command: |
            echo 'Codebase approved, deliver to production environment'
      - run:
          name: Deploy
          command: |
            echo 'Deploy changes to production'
            # Add your deployment steps here
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### [Tavis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.8"
install:
  - pip install poetry
  - poetry install
script:
  - poetry run pytest
after_success:
  - echo 'Codebase approved, deliver to production environment'
  - echo 'Deploy changes to production'
  # Add your deployment steps here
```
