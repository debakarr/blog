### Building docker image

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and system dependencies. These images are built based on instructions provided in a Dockerfile, which contains a set of commands and configurations.

A Dockerfile might look something like this:

```Dockerfile
# This line specifies the base image for our Docker image. 
# In this case, we're using the official Python 3.9-slim image as the starting point.
FROM python:3.9-slim

# This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. 
# Any subsequent commands will be executed in this directory.
WORKDIR /app

# This copies the requirements.txt file from the host machine to the working directory of the container. 
# This file should contain the necessary Python dependencies for your FastAPI application.
COPY requirements.txt .

# This command installs the Python dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file using pip.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# This copies the entire application code from the host machine to the working directory of the container.
COPY . .

# This instruction exposes port 7400 to allow communication with the FastAPI application running inside the container.
EXPOSE 7400

# This sets the default command to be executed when the container starts. 
# It uses the uvicorn server to run the FastAPI application specified in the main.py file, 
# and binds it to the host's IP address 0.0.0.0 on port 7400.
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7400"]
```

Once you have this Dockerfile in your project directory, you can use the `docker build` command to build the Docker image. For example:

```console
docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
```

After successfully building the image, you can run a container using the image with the `docker run` command:

```console
docker run -p 7400:7400 my-fastapi-app
```

This will start the container and bind port 7400 of the container to port 7400 of the host machine, allowing you to access the FastAPI application at `http://localhost:7400`.

### Managing Docker images

Once you have built a Docker image, you can manage it efficiently using various Docker commands. Here are some essential Docker commands for image management:

1. `docker tag`: The `docker tag` command allows you to add a new tag to an existing image. Tags are labels that provide a human-readable and meaningful name to an image, making it easier to reference and manage.
2. `docker images`: This command lists all the Docker images present on your system along with their details such as the image ID, repository, tag, size, and creation date.
3. `docker push`: Once you have built your image and want to share it with others, you can use the `docker push` command. It allows you to push your local image to a remote registry, making it accessible to others.
4. `docker pull`: If you want to fetch an image from a remote registry, you can use the `docker pull` command. This command downloads the specified image from a registry like Docker Hub to your local machine.
5. `docker rmi`: If you want to remove an existing image from your local machine, you can use the `docker rmi` command followed by the image ID or repository name. This command helps you clean up unused or outdated images.

#### Example

```console
# To add the "latest" tag to the Python FastAPI application image, you can use
$ docker tag my-fastapi-app my-fastapi-app:latest

# This command lists all the Docker images present on your local machine. 
# It displays the repository, tag, image ID, creation date, and size of each image.
$ docker images
REPOSITORY            TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
