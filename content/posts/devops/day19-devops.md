In this blog post, we will explore Ansible roles, their benefits, and how to use them in your playbooks. We'll also discuss best practices for organizing and structuring your Ansible projects.

### Ansible Roles: Basics and Creating

Ansible roles provide a well-defined structure for organizing your tasks, variables, handlers, metadata, templates, and other files. They allow you to reuse and share your Ansible code efficiently across multiple projects without duplicating the code. This makes your projects more manageable and easier to maintain.

A simple example of using roles in a playbook can be found in the official Ansible documentation:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - common
    - webservers
```

In this example, the common and webservers roles are applied to the webservers group of hosts.

### Sharing Roles with Ansible Galaxy

Ansible Galaxy is a public repository for sharing and discovering Ansible roles created by the community. You can search and download roles that fit your use case, saving time and leveraging the expertise of other users.

For example, to install a PostgreSQL server role from Ansible Galaxy, you can run:

```console
$ ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.postgresql
Starting galaxy role install process
- downloading role 'postgresql', owned by geerlingguy
- downloading role from https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-postgresql/archive/3.4.3.tar.gz
- extracting geerlingguy.postgresql to /home/debakarr/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.postgresql
- geerlingguy.postgresql (3.4.3) was installed successfully
```

And then use it in a playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: linux-host
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: geerlingguy.postgresql
      vars:
        postgresql_users:
          - name: debakarr
```
