Terraform configuration files are usually written in HCL (Hashicorp configuration Language) syntax. Although we can also write it in JSON. But it is recommended to write it in HCL as all the documentation is written in HCL and also it is a bit easier to read than JSON. The file extension is usaually *.tf*.

A Terraform configuration file usually include resource definition, variable definition, data source and other infrastructure components. Here is an example for a nginx docker container in a main.tf file.

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial-debakarr"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}
```

This example is from the official site. You will usually use these `terraform` commands:

- `terraform init`: Initializes the working directory, which includes downloading and installing any required providers and creating the backend configuration.
- `terraform validate`: Validates the configuration files in a directory.
- `terraform plan`: Creates an execution plan to reach a desired state of the infrastructure.
- `terraform apply`: Makes the changes in the infrastructure as defined in the plan.
- `terraform destroy`: Deletes all the old infrastructure resources.

When you execute the Terraform commands (`terraform init`, `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy`) on the provided `main.tf` file, the following actions take place:

1. `terraform init`:
   - Initializes the working directory and sets up the necessary backend configuration.
   - Downloads and installs the required provider, which is the Docker provider in this case (`kreuzwerker/docker` version `~> 3.0.1`).

2. `terraform validate`:
   - Validates the configuration files (`main.tf`) for syntax errors and other issues.
   - Ensures that the configuration is valid and can be processed by Terraform.

3. `terraform plan`:
   - Creates an execution plan by analyzing the current state and the desired state specified in the configuration.
   - Determines what actions need to be taken to reach the desired state.
   - In this case, it will analyze that a Docker image and container need to be created.

4. `terraform apply`:
   - Executes the actions defined in the plan created by `terraform plan`.
   - It provisions and manages the Docker resources defined in the configuration.
   - Downloads the specified Docker image (`nginx`) and creates a container based on that image.
   - Maps port 80 from the container to port 8000 externally.

5. `terraform destroy`:
   - Deletes the resources that were created by Terraform.
   - In this case, it will delete the Docker container and image that were previously created.
   - This command helps in cleaning up the infrastructure resources when they are no longer needed or to start fresh.

```console
debakarr@debakarr-mobl MINGW64 /c/Source/tf-demo/docker
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of kreuzwerker/docker from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

debakarr@debakarr-mobl MINGW64 /c/Source/tf-demo/docker
$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:
