### Reverse String
 
[Link to original Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string//)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

**Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.**

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["h","e","l","l","o"]
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

**Company:**

**Solution (Python Way):**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        # Using [::-1] to reverse the string
        s[:] = s[::-1]
```

**Solution (Iterative):**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        # Keep two reference to the first and the last element of the list, say left and right respectively
        # Now until left is greater than right, swap left and right element and increament left and decreament right
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

**Solution (Recursive):**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        # Logic is same as the one in iterative solution
        if not len(s):
            return []
        
        self.reverseStringHelper(0, len(s) - 1, s)
        
    def reverseStringHelper(self, left, right, s):
        if left >= right:
            return
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        self.reverseStringHelper(left + 1, right - 1, s)
```
