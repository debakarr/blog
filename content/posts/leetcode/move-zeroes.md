### Move Zeroes
 
[Link to original Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an array **nums**, write a function to move all **0's** to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

**Input:** [0,1,0,3,12]
**Output:** [1,3,12,0,0]

**Note:**

You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

**Company:**
*Amazon*, *Bloomberg*, *Paytm*, *Samsung*

**Solution:**

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # One solution will be to keep track of where to place the next non-zero number
        # We have to start with index 0
        index = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[index] = nums[i]
                index += 1
                
        # Once we have traverse through the whole list we now basically have count of the non-zero number in index
        # i.e. number of non-zero element = index
        # and number of zeroes = len(nums) - index
        # So we fill all the remaining places (len(nums) - index) with zeroes
                
        for i in range(index, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0
```

**Solution (Optimal):**

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Another solution which is same as the previous one but more optimal
        # Instead of replacing the number at the particular index, 
        # we can swap it with the one which is present in the index where we need to place non-zero number
        # We have to start with index 0
        index = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[index], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[index]
                index += 1
```
